The Task Board project is an intuitive task management application inspired by Kanban principles, enabling users to efficiently organize and monitor their tasks. This tool was created to provide an interactive way for users to add tasks, transition them through various stages of completion, and use visual indicators like color coding to highlight approaching deadlines.

Developed to strengthen my proficiency with third-party APIs such as jQuery UI and Day.js, the app also enhances my skills in JavaScript DOM manipulation and localStorage management. 

This project addresses the challenge of task organization and progress tracking, empowering users to manage their to-do lists visually with seamless drag-and-drop functionality.

Main Features:
Create new tasks by entering a title, description, and due date.
View tasks organized into three categories: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
Easily move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop functionality to reflect their status.


Tasks are visually highlighted with color coding: yellow indicates upcoming deadlines, while red signifies overdue tasks.


All tasks are saved in localStorage, ensuring they remain accessible even after the page is refreshed.
